# CUI / CMMC Readiness Self-Check

**Complete this checklist with your team. Be honest. The gaps you find now are the gaps an assessor will find later.**

---

## Contract Awareness

- [ ] We have reviewed our DoD contracts for DFARS 252.204-7012 (Safeguarding CDI / Cyber Incident Reporting)
- [ ] We have reviewed our contracts for DFARS 252.204-7020 (NIST 800-171 Assessment Requirements)
- [ ] We have reviewed our contracts for DFARS 252.204-7021 (CMMC Requirements)
- [ ] We know which CMMC level our contracts will require
- [ ] We have identified which subcontracts require DFARS flow-down

## CUI Identification

- [ ] We have determined which project deliverables qualify as CUI
- [ ] We know what CUI categories apply to our work (e.g., Controlled Technical Information)
- [ ] Our CUI documents are marked per NARA CUI Registry guidance
- [ ] We have a CUI handling and storage plan
- [ ] Our team members know what CUI is and how to recognize it

## System Security Plan (SSP)

- [ ] We have a documented System Security Plan
- [ ] The SSP identifies the boundaries of our CUI environment
- [ ] The SSP maps our controls to NIST SP 800-171 requirements
- [ ] The SSP is current (reviewed/updated within the past 12 months)
- [ ] A responsible individual is named as the SSP owner

## NIST 800-171 Assessment

- [ ] We have completed a self-assessment against all 110 NIST 800-171 requirements
- [ ] We have a Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M) for any unmet requirements
- [ ] Our self-assessment score has been entered in SPRS
- [ ] A senior official has signed the SPRS affirmation
- [ ] The assessment is current (within the past 3 years or as contract requires)

## Access Control & Data Protection

- [ ] Our CUI environment has defined access controls (not everyone has access to everything)
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication is enabled for remote access to CUI systems
- [ ] Shared project repositories have role-based access configured
- [ ] We monitor for unusual access patterns (bulk downloads, off-hours access)
- [ ] Encryption is used for CUI at rest and in transit

## Incident Response

- [ ] We have a documented incident response plan
- [ ] The plan includes the 72-hour DoD reporting requirement (DC3 via DIBNet)
- [ ] Team members know who to contact and what to do if they suspect a breach
- [ ] We have preserved forensic capability (logging enabled and retained)
- [ ] We have tested or exercised the incident response plan within the past year

## Subcontractor Management

- [ ] DFARS 252.204-7012 is flowed down to all applicable subcontractors
- [ ] We have verified that subcontractors have their own SSP and SPRS score
- [ ] Subcontractor access to CUI is limited to what is necessary for their scope
- [ ] Subcontract agreements address CUI handling, marking, and return/destruction

## Scoring Guide

Count your checked boxes:

| Checked | Assessment |
|---------|-----------|
| 28–32 | Strong foundation. Focus on continuous improvement and evidence collection. |
| 20–27 | Moderate gaps. Prioritize SSP completion, SPRS submission, and CUI scoping. |
| 12–19 | Significant gaps. Begin with contract review, CUI identification, and SSP development. |
| 0–11 | Critical gaps. Immediate action required before next contract award or renewal. |

**This checklist is not a substitute for a formal NIST 800-171 assessment. It is a starting point for identifying where your organization stands today.**
