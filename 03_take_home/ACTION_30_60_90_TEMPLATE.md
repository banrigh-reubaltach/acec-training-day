## 30 Days — Assess & Identify

**Objective:** Know where you stand.

| # | Action Item | Owner | Due Date | Status |
|---|------------|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Review all active DoD contracts/subcontracts for DFARS 252.204-7012, -7020, -7021 | | | |
| 2 | Identify which project deliverables may qualify as CUI | | | |
| 3 | Determine required CMMC level for each contract | | | |
| 4 | Locate or begin drafting a System Security Plan (SSP) | | | |
| 5 | Check SPRS for existing self-assessment score (or confirm no score exists) | | | |
| 6 | Identify who in the organization owns CMMC compliance | | | |

**30-Day Milestone:** We know our contracts, our CUI scope, and our current compliance posture.

## 60 Days — Plan & Prioritize

**Objective:** Close the highest-risk gaps first.

| # | Action Item | Owner | Due Date | Status |
|---|------------|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Complete or update the NIST 800-171 self-assessment | | | |
| 2 | Document a Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M) for unmet controls | | | |
| 3 | Submit self-assessment score to SPRS (with senior official affirmation) | | | |
| 4 | Implement or verify CUI marking on applicable documents | | | |
| 5 | Review and update subcontractor flow-down clauses | | | |
| 6 | Draft or test an incident response plan (including 72-hour DC3 reporting) | | | |

**60-Day Milestone:** SSP is documented, SPRS score is submitted, and highest-risk controls are addressed.

## 90 Days — Implement & Sustain

**Objective:** Build habits, not just documents.

| # | Action Item | Owner | Due Date | Status |
|---|------------|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Train project teams on CUI identification and handling | | | |
| 2 | Verify subcontractor compliance (SSP, SPRS score, access controls) | | | |
| 3 | Implement monitoring for CUI environment (access logs, anomaly detection) | | | |
| 4 | Conduct a tabletop exercise or incident response drill | | | |
| 5 | Schedule recurring compliance review (quarterly or per contract cadence) | | | |
| 6 | Brief executive leadership on compliance status and remaining risks | | | |

**90-Day Milestone:** Compliance is operational, not theoretical. Evidence exists. Reviews are scheduled.
