# Save This

## What to Keep

Everything in this folder is yours to take back to your organization:

| File | What It Is |
|------|-----------|
| `CUI_CMMC_REFERENCE_GUIDE.md` | Plain-language guide to CUI, CMMC levels, and what A/E firms should verify |
| `READINESS_SELF_CHECK.md` | 32-item checklist to assess your current compliance posture |
| `ACTION_30_60_90_TEMPLATE.md` | Structured action plan template with milestones at 30, 60, and 90 days |

## What to Revisit Quarterly

- [ ] Has your SPRS score been updated?
- [ ] Have new contracts added DFARS or CMMC requirements?
- [ ] Have subcontractor compliance statuses changed?
- [ ] Has your System Security Plan been reviewed and updated?
- [ ] Have you conducted an incident response exercise?

Set a calendar reminder. Compliance is not a one-time event.

## What to Do Next

1. Complete the **Readiness Self-Check** with your contracts, IT, and project management teams
2. Start the **30/60/90 Action Plan** — assign owners and dates this week
3. Share the **CUI/CMMC Reference Guide** with anyone in your organization who touches DoD work
4. Run the tabletop exercise with your project team — the materials are in the training package

The questions raised in today's training are the same questions an assessor will ask. The difference is whether you have answers ready.
