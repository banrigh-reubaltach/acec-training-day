# CUI & CMMC Reference Guide

**For A/E firms, contractors, and integrators working on federally funded projects.**
**Bookmark this. Share it with your team. Revisit it before your next DoD proposal.**

## What Is CUI?

**Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)** is information that requires safeguarding under law, regulation, or government policy — but is **not classified.**

The CUI program was established by Executive Order 13556 to replace the patchwork of agency-specific markings (FOUO, SBU, LES, etc.) with a single, standardized system managed by the National Archives (NARA).

### Examples Relevant to A/E Firms

- Engineering drawings for DoD-funded facilities
- Network architecture diagrams for control systems
- PLC and controller configurations
- Facility security and vulnerability assessments
- Controlled Technical Information (CTI) as defined in DFARS

**Key point:** CUI is not classified, but it is not public. It must be marked, handled, and protected according to specific requirements.

## What Triggers CMMC?

The **Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC)** program applies when a DoD contract includes:

- **DFARS 252.204-7012** — Safeguarding Covered Defense Information (already in most DoD contracts)
- **DFARS 252.204-7021** — CMMC Certification Requirements (being phased in under 32 CFR Part 170)

If your contract involves **Federal Contract Information (FCI)** or **Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)**, some level of CMMC applies to you.

## CMMC Levels

| | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Applies to** | FCI (Federal Contract Information) | CUI (Controlled Unclassified Information) | Highest-priority CUI programs |
| **Based on** | 15 practices from FAR 52.204-21 | 110 requirements from NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2 | NIST SP 800-172 (enhanced) |
| **Assessment** | Annual self-assessment | Self-assessment OR C3PAO (per contract) | Government-led (DIBCAC) |
| **Score reported in** | SPRS | SPRS (self) or CMMC eMASS (C3PAO) | Government systems |

**Most A/E firms on DoD projects will need Level 1 at minimum. If your deliverables include CUI, Level 2 applies.**

---

## Self-Assessment vs. C3PAO

**Self-Assessment:**
- Your organization evaluates its own compliance
- A senior official signs an affirmation of accuracy
- Results submitted to SPRS
- Must be current for contract award eligibility

**C3PAO (Certified Third-Party Assessor Organization):**
- Independent assessment by an accredited organization
- Required for Level 2 contracts that the DoD designates as requiring third-party verification
- Results in a 3-year CMMC certification
- Must be achieved before contract award

## What A/E Firms Should Verify Now

### 1. Check Your Contracts
Do your current DoD contracts or subcontracts include DFARS 252.204-7012, 252.204-7020, or 252.204-7021? If yes, CMMC requirements are active or imminent.

### 2. Determine CUI Scope
Have you identified which project deliverables qualify as CUI? Engineering drawings, control system designs, and network architecture on DoD-funded projects may be Controlled Technical Information.

### 3. Document Your Security
Do you have a System Security Plan (SSP)? NIST 800-171 requires one. If you don't have it, you are not compliant — regardless of what controls you've implemented.

### 4. Submit Your Score
Have you completed a NIST 800-171 self-assessment and entered the score in SPRS? This is required under DFARS 252.204-7020. No score in SPRS may mean no eligibility for award.

### 5. Check Your Subcontractors
Do your subcontracts flow down DFARS 252.204-7012? If your subs handle CUI and are not compliant, your firm carries the risk.

### 6. Prepare for Incidents
DFARS 252.204-7012 requires reporting cyber incidents to the DoD Cyber Crime Center (DC3) within 72 hours. If you don't have an incident response plan, you cannot meet this requirement.
